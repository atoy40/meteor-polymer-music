Music
=====

This is a project to demonstrate the meteor integration with Polymer.
The goals is to use meteor/ddp collections directly into polymer
components.

Polymer components :

* meteor-collection : create a Mongo collection
* meteor-subscribe : subscribe to a server publication
* meteor-query : query and observe a collection

They're used in the [music-app](public/components/music-app.html)
components.

Polymer meteor-x components are defined in
[meteor-collection.html](public/components/meteor-collection.html). This
project is at a very early stage and a lot of features will be added.
