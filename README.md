Music
=====

This is a project to demonstrate the meteor integration with Polymer.
The goals is to use meteor/ddp collections directly into polymer
components.

Polymer components :

* [meteor-status](public/components/meteor-status.html) : a reactive binding to Meteor.status()
* [meteor-collection](public/components/meteor-collection.html) : create a Mongo collection
* [meteor-subscribe](public/components/meteor-collection.html) : subscribe to a server publication
* [meteor-query](public/components/meteor-collection.html) : query and observe a collection

They're used in the [music-app](public/components/music-app.html)
components.

This project is at a very early stage and a lot of features will be added.
