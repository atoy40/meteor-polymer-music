Music
=====

This is a project to demonstrate the meteor integration with Polymer.
The goals is to use meteor/ddp collections directly into polymer
components.

Polymer components :

* meteor-collection : create a Mongo collection
* meteor-subscribe : subscribe to a server publication
* meteor-query : query a collection

They're used in the [music-demo](public/components/music-demo.html)
components.
